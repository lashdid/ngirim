File transfer website with 6-digit key sharing system. **( In Progress )**

### What is that?
It's a website to transfer files with a system exactly like [SendAnywhere](https://send-anywhere.com/). I am using this [SendAnywhere Web API](https://github.com/estmob/SendAnywhere-Web-API) to build this.

### How to use it?
**Sender**
- Click the button to send the file
- Add files to the form then send
- 6-digit code should appear

**Receiver**
- Input the 6-digit code to the input field
- Wait until transfer is finished
- Download the file

### Why did i made this?
Because the official [SendAnywhere](https://send-anywhere.com/) website doesn't support on mobile ( you have to install the app or switch to desktop view). Even if i rarely use this website, i have to switch to desktop view on mobile when i want to use it and i'm too lazy for that.
