File transfer website with 6-digit key sharing system.

> :warning: Don't send anything private here! Because anyone can see your files in this website's database

Your file in database will automatically deleted after 1 day.

### What is that?
It's a website to transfer files with a system exactly like [SendAnywhere](https://send-anywhere.com/). I am using Firebase Cloud Storage to build this.

### How to use it?
**Sender**
- Click / drop to add file
- Click the "Send" button
- 6-digit code should appear

**Receiver**
- Input the 6-digit code to the input field
- Wait until transfer is finished
- Download the file

### Why did i made this?
Because the official [SendAnywhere](https://send-anywhere.com/) website has 5 seconds ad and doesn't support on mobile ( you have to install the app or switch to desktop view). Even if i rarely use this website, i have to switch to desktop view on mobile and wait 5 seconds for the ad when i want to use it and i'm too lazy for that.

Also to learn SolidJS and Firebase.
